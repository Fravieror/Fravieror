# 💻 Francisco Diaz  

## Hi there, I'm Francisco Diaz 👋  

Automation-focused **Software & AI Systems Engineer** with 10+ years of experience building scalable, cloud-native systems across finance, insurance, marketplaces, HR platforms, and developer tooling.

My career started in traditional software engineering and evolved toward **automation-first architectures, AI-driven workflows, and distributed systems**. I design systems that are reliable, observable, and reduce operational overhead through thoughtful engineering.
